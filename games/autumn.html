Project Autumn is an artistic cozy game landscape where two robots explore an archipelago, with a focus on the collection mechanics and minigames. My responsibilities included developing a camera control system, designing climbing and other traversal mechanics, companion AI, and bug fixing duties as assigned. Additionally, I worked on engineering the character controller to support modular abilities across the two playable characters and ensure smooth transitions between player control and AI-following behavior.
