        <p>Joe n’ Jo is an innovative physics-based co-op platformer game. In this game, two players control the heads of two giraffes that are tied together to overcome an obstacle-based landscape. I designed and programmed the cooperative player controller in Godot, iterating on physics calculations and collision behavior to optimize precise player control while retaining intentional limitations to maintain gameplay difficulty. Additionally, I troubleshot and fixed network replication lag issues related to physics bodies to increase game responsiveness.</p>
