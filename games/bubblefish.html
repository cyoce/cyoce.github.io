            Bubblefish Bonanza is a couch co-op racing game where players control the fins of fish and emit bubbles to propel characters through an obstacle course landscape. I calibrated a physics-based player controller, designed to balance fun and playability with a chaotic feel. I also created soft-body visuals for airbags.
